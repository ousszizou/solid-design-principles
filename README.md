# SOLID PRINCIPLES

## Signle Responsibility Principle (SRP)

“The class should solve one problem it should have a single reason to change.”

“Do one thing and do it well.”

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

“the class should be open for extension, closed for modifications.”

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

“if you substitute any type with one of its subtypes, the behavior should not change.”

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

“avoid making general interface contain all methods.”

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

“higher level classes should not know the implementation of low level classes but depends on abstraction.”
